# MCP Memory - Intelligent Coding Philosophy Knowledge Base

**MCP Memory** is an **MCP Server** that gives **MCP Clients (Cursor, Claude, Windsurf and more)** the **ability to remember** coding patterns, preferences, and philosophy **across conversations and projects**. Originally a simple user preference memory system, it has evolved into an intelligent knowledge base specifically designed for software development workflows.

## üéØ Project Goals

1. **Persistent Coding Knowledge**: Store and retrieve coding patterns, preferences, and discovered solutions across sessions
2. **Intelligent Search**: Use vector embeddings to find conceptually related information, not just keyword matches
3. **Proactive Assistance**: Provide contextual prompts and reminders to search relevant patterns before starting tasks
4. **Learning System**: Automatically categorize, expand queries, and improve relevance over time
5. **Development Workflow Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with ADD/TDD practices and development methodologies

## üöÄ Current Functionality

### Core Features
- **Vector-based Memory Storage**: Store text with AI-generated embeddings for semantic search
- **Multi-namespace Support**: Organize memories by user, project, or system-wide scopes
- **Soft Deletes**: Safely remove memories while maintaining data integrity
- **Cross-namespace Search**: Find patterns across all your projects and contexts

### Intelligent Enhancements (NEW)
- **Auto-categorization**: Automatically tags memories with language, domain, and pattern type
- **Query Expansion**: Searches are automatically expanded using vector similarity to find related content
- **Relevance Scoring**: Results are scored based on:
  - User preference signals
  - Recency (newer memories score higher)
  - Session context (what you've been searching for)
  - Code example presence
- **Session Context Tracking**: The system learns from your search patterns within a session
- **MCP Prompts**: Contextual prompts for common development tasks
- **Smart Suggestions**: Get related search suggestions based on your results

### MCP Protocol Features
- **Tools**: 
  - `addToMCPMemory` - Store patterns with automatic categorization
  - `searchMCPMemory` - Enhanced search with query expansion
  - `searchAllMemories` - Cross-namespace discovery
  - `deleteMemory` - Soft delete specific memories
  - `deleteNamespace` - Clean up entire namespaces
- **Prompts** (NEW):
  - `search_philosophy` - Search before starting tasks
  - `remember_pattern` - Store discovered patterns
  - `session_start` - Initialize session with relevant patterns
- **Resources** (NEW):
  - `memory://philosophy/guide` - Complete usage guide
  - `memory://philosophy/recent` - Recently added patterns

### Technical Implementation
- Built with Cloudflare Workers, D1, Vectorize (RAG), Durable Objects, Workers AI and Agents
- Uses `@cf/baai/bge-m3` model for embeddings (1024 dimensions)
- Implements rate limiting (100 req/min) for security
- Supports soft deletes with `deleted_at` timestamps
- Stores conversation context and metadata for richer memories

### Option 1: One-Click Deploy Your Own MCP Memory to Cloudflare

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/puliczek/mcp-memory)

In **Create Vectorize** section choose:
- **Dimensions:** 1024
- **Metric:** cosine

Click button **"Create and Deploy"**

In Cloudflare dashboard, go to "Workers & Pages" and click on Visit

![Visit MCP Memory](/visit.png)


### Option 2: Use this template
1. Click the "Use this template" button at the top of this repository
2. Clone your new repository
3. Follow the setup instructions below

### Option 3: Create with CloudFlare CLI

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest --git https://github.com/puliczek/mcp-memory
```

## üîß Setup (Only Option 2 & 3)

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a Vectorize index:
```bash
npx wrangler vectorize create mcp-memory-vectorize --dimensions 1024 --metric cosine
```

3. Install Wrangler:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Deploy the worker:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

## üß† How It Works

![MCP Memory Architecture](/arch.png)


1. **Storing Memories**:
   - Your text is processed by **Cloudflare Workers AI** using the open-source `@cf/baai/bge-m3` model to generate embeddings
   - The text and its vector embedding are stored in two places:
     - **Cloudflare Vectorize**: Stores the vector embeddings for similarity search
     - **Cloudflare D1**: Stores the original text and metadata for persistence
   - A **Durable Object** (MyMCP) manages the state and ensures consistency
   - The **Agents** framework handles the **MCP protocol** communication

2. **Retrieving Memories**:
   - Your query is converted to a vector using **Workers AI** with the same `@cf/baai/bge-m3` model
   - Vectorize performs similarity search to find relevant memories
   - Results are ranked by similarity score
   - The **D1 database** provides the original text for matched vectors
   - The **Durable Object** coordinates the retrieval process

This architecture enables:
- Fast vector similarity search through Vectorize
- Persistent storage with D1
- Stateful operations via Durable Objects
- Standardized AI interactions through Workers AI
- Protocol compliance via the Agents framework

The system finds conceptually related information even when the exact words don't match.

## üîí Security

MCP Memory implements several security measures to protect user data:

- Each user's memories are stored in **isolated namespaces** within Vectorize for data separation
- Built-in **rate limiting** prevents abuse (**100 req/min** - you can change it in wrangler.jsonc)
- **Authentication is based on userId only**
  - While this is sufficient for basic protection due to rate limiting
  - Additional authentication layers (like API keys or OAuth) can be easily added if needed
- All data is stored in Cloudflare's secure infrastructure
- All communications are secured with industry-standard TLS encryption (automatically provided by Cloudflare's SSL/TLS certification)



## üí∞ Cost Information - FREE for Most Users

MCP Memory is free to use for normal usage levels:
- Free tier allows 1,000 memories with ~28,000 queries per month
- Uses Cloudflare's free quota for Workers, Vectorize, Worker AI and D1 database
