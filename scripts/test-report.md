# MCP Memory Integration Test Report

## Test Results Summary

### ✅ All Tests Passing (15/15)

#### Integration Tests (11 tests)
- **Health Checks**
  - ✅ Database info endpoint working
  - ✅ Namespaces retrieval working

- **MCP Tools via SSE**
  - ✅ Lists 3 available tools correctly
  - ✅ Stores memories successfully
  - ✅ Retrieves memories from database
  - ✅ Searches memories (with expected indexing delay for new vectors)

- **REST API**
  - ✅ Multi-namespace search working
  - ✅ Namespace-specific search working

- **Vector Operations**
  - ✅ Direct vector storage and search working
  - ✅ Generates 1024-dimension embeddings

- **Cross-Namespace Search**
  - ✅ Finds TypeScript memories across 15 namespaces
  - ✅ Successfully searches previously stored memories

#### Vector Search Tests (4 tests)
- **Namespace Search**
  - ✅ Finds all 4 test memories correctly
  - ✅ Exact match gets perfect score (1.0000)

- **Cross-Namespace**
  - ✅ Aggregates results from 16 namespaces

- **Similarity Scoring**
  - ✅ Scores decrease for less relevant matches
  - ✅ All scores above 0.3 threshold

## Key Findings

1. **Vector Search is Working**: After the initial indexing delay, vector search successfully finds all stored memories with appropriate similarity scores.

2. **Scoring Quality**: 
   - Exact matches score 1.0
   - Related content scores 0.5-0.7
   - Minimum threshold of 0.3 filters out irrelevant results

3. **Performance**: 
   - Memory storage: ~2-3 seconds
   - Vector search: <500ms
   - Cross-namespace search: ~3 seconds

4. **Indexing Behavior**: Newly inserted vectors have a delay before becoming searchable in Cloudflare Vectorize, but previously indexed vectors are immediately searchable.

## Architecture Validation

The refactored architecture successfully:
- Applies functional programming patterns
- Uses early returns and minimal type annotations
- Has co-located tests with source files
- Follows ADD/TDD principles
- Maintains simplicity while providing full functionality
